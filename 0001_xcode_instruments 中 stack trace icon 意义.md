The process view display of the debug navigator displays the backtrace of your paused app organized by either thread or Grand Central Dispatch queues. With this tool you can debug the control flow of Swift or C-based code as well as OpenGL frames. The backtrace is displayed with each stack frame identified by an icon. The icons tell you where in the compiled code the stack frame originates.
